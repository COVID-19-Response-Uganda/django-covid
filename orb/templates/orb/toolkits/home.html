<h3>{% trans 'Community Health Framework' %}</h3></a>

<p>The Community Health Framework assists non-technical audiences in
	understanding community health and how it can be strengthened. An
	interactive power point, published under a Creative Commons license, it
	depicts the community health ecosystem as heath-specific and
	health-enabling actors and structures (formal and informal) working
	together to ensure that each has the agency, access, and resources to
	ensure the health of community members. It also includes a Toolkit with
	models and case studies as examples of good practice.</p>

<h3>{% trans 'Principles for Digital Development' %}</h3></a>

<p>The Principles for Digital Development (in English, Español,
	Français, or Português) find their roots in the efforts of individuals,
	development organizations, and donors alike who have called for a more
	concerted effort by donors and implementing partners to
	institutionalize lessons learned in the use of information and
	communication technologies (ICTs) in development projects. They were
	written by and for international development donors and their
	implementing partners, but are freely available for use by all. The
	Principles are intended to serve as guidance rather than edict, and to
	be updated and refined over time.</p>

<h3>{% trans 'Financing Framework to End Preventable Child and Maternal Deaths (EPCMD)' %}</h3></a>

<p>The U.S. Government is committed to achieving the once
	unimaginable goal of Ending Preventable Child and Maternal Deaths
	(EPCMD) by 2035. Achieving this goal in a sustainable fashion implies a
	gradual move toward solutions that mobilize both domestic and
	international resources, with the objective of putting developing
	country health systems on a trajectory toward financial sustainability.</p>

<p>The Financing Framework is designed to outline ways in which
	additional financial resources and tools can be utilized to support
	sustainability. The Framework draws on inspiration from best practices
	used throughout the U.S. Agency for International Development and with
	our health partners around the world.</p>
