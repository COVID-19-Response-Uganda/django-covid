REST API
=====================================


The REST API is still under development.

There is an example of the search API running at: http://alexlittle.net/mpowering/

Current versions of the API helper libraries can be found at:

* for PHP: https://github.com/mPowering/mpowering-api-php
* for Python: https://github.com/mPowering/mpowering-api-python

These helper libraries also include some examples of how to use the API.

Accessing the API

	Currently, for any POST, PUT or DELETE method requests, you will need to contact us so we can enable your account for these API methods.
