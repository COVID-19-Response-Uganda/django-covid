<p>If youâ€™re interested in being an ORB Content Partner, we would
	like to hear from you!</p>

<p>As a Content Partner, we will create an ORB partner page with
	your logo, a short description of your organisation and a link back to
	your home page. We will also help connect with you other partners who
	may want to use your content or commission new content from you.</p>
<p>In return, you will commit to sharing your digital health
	resources with us using an open content license, including your updated
	or new resources, and to being an ambassador for ORB (promoting its use
	by implementers, health workers and others).</p>
